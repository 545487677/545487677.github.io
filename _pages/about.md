Hello! I am **Guojiang Zhao** (you can also call me **Cody**), currently working at **DP Technology**, where I am fortunate to be mentored by [**Zhifeng Gao**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uBo3SJcAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on **molecular design**, **large language models (LLMs) reasoning**, and **agents**. Broadly, my interests lie in **AI for Science (AI4S)**, particularly in **molecular and materials generation, virtual characterization, and property prediction**. Building on these directions, I am now exploring **LLM-driven reasoning frameworks and multi-agent systems** to advance intelligent scientific discovery and molecular design.

I received my **M.S. in Information Systems Management** from **Carnegie Mellon University** in 2023, and my **B.S. in Information and Computing Science (Mathematics track)** from **Xiâ€™an University of Posts and Telecommunications (XUPT)**, where I graduated **first in my major**. In addition, I have had visiting research experiences at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)** and the [**Stan Z. Li Lab**](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/stan-zq-li.html) at **Westlake University**. Previously, I also gained industry research experience through internships at **Huawei**, **MetaApp**, and **Tencent (WeChat Pay)**.

If you are interested in **AI4S, LLM reasoning, or intelligent agents**, feel free to reach out â€” I am always happy to discuss and collaborate! -->
