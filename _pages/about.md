### ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
- **Molecular design**
- **Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning**
- **Self-evolving agents**
- **AI for Science (AI4S)**: molecular & materials generation, virtual characterization, property prediction

Currently, I am exploring **LLM-driven reasoning frameworks** and **multi-agent systems** to advance intelligent scientific discovery and molecular design.

<!-- Hello! I am Guojiang Zhao (you can also call me Cody), currently working at DP Technology, where I am fortunate to be mentored by [**Zhifeng Gao**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uBo3SJcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [**Guolin Ke**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M2qJgtoAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on molecular design, large language models (LLMs) reasoning, and self-evolving agents. Broadly, my interests lie in AI for Science (AI4S), particularly in molecular and materials generation, virtual characterization, and property prediction. Building on these directions, I am now exploring LLM-driven reasoning frameworks and multi-agent systems to advance intelligent scientific discovery and molecular design. I received my M.S. in Information Systems Management from Carnegie Mellon University in 2023, and my B.S. in Information and Computing Science (Mathematics track) from Xiâ€™an University of Posts and Telecommunications (XUPT), where I ranked first in my major. In addition, I have had visiting research experiences at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the [**Stan Z. Li Lab**](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/stan-zq-li.html) at Westlake University. Previously, I also gained industry research experience through internships at Huawei, MetaApp, and WeChat (Tencent).

If you are interested in AI4S, LLM reasoning, or intelligent agents, feel free to reach out â€” I am always happy to discuss and collaborate! (Email: cody545487677@gmail.com (Preferred); guojianz@alumni.cmu.edu; zhaogj@dp.tech) -->
